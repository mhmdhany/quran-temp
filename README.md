An Islamic Template for getting some Ahadiths, Ayat and Praying Times. I used (HTML,CSS,JS) in this template.
I used a three api's in this template.
[1] The First Api was (https://api.hadith.gading.dev/books/bukhari?range=300-500) to get Some Ahdiths.
[2] The Second Api was (http://api.alquran.cloud/v1/meta) to get Sorah's name. 
[3] The Third Api was (http://api.aladhan.com/v1/timingsByCity?city=cairo&country=egypt&method=8) to get Praying Times.
